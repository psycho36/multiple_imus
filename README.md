Multiple IMUs (I2C Devices)
I am using a programme given here:
https://horizonlab.co/2017/04/19/multiple-imus/

I have also tested the programme given by Jeff Rowberg for MPU6050 dmp :https://github.com/jrowberg
In my case I am using Multiplexer CD4051BE. It is an analog MUX. It may not be very accurate as I2C MUX. But works. 
I found this image: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ip60w.png on :http://www.gammon.com.au/i2c
The circuit works properly.
